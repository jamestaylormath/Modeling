# Modeling/HomeCreditDefaultRisk
Working with the "Home Credit Default Risk" dataset from Kaggle.

This project will contain four notebooks:
1) Exploratory analysis on the primary table from the training data
2) Baseline model building (using the primary table from the training data to construct an XGB Classifier model)
3) Data imputation/feature engineering using all of the dataset's tables
4) Creating fine-tuned models that outperform our baseline model
