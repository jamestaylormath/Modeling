# Modeling/HomeCreditDefaultRisk
Working with the "Home Credit Default Risk" dataset from Kaggle.

This project will contain four notebooks:
1) Exploratory analysis on the primary table from the training data
2) Basic model building (using the primary table from the training data to construct logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and gradient boosting models)
3) Feature engineering using the dataset's secondary tables
4) Using the first and third notebooks to create more fine-tuned models.
